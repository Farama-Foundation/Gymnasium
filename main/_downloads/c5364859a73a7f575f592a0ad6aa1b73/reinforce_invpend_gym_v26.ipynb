To understand how to implement REINFORCE [1] from scratch to solve Mujoco's InvertedPendulum-v4\n 2. Implementation a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with Gymnasium's v0.26+ `step()` function\n\nWe will be using **REINFORCE**, one of the earliest policy gradient methods. Unlike going under the burden of learning a value function first and then deriving a policy out of it,\nREINFORCE optimizes the policy directly. In other words, it is trained to maximize the probability of Monte-Carlo returns. More on that later.\n\n**Inverted Pendulum** is Mujoco's cartpole but now powered by the Mujoco physics simulator -\nwhich allows more complex experiments (such as varying the effects of gravity).\nThis environment involves a cart that can moved linearly, with a pole fixed on it at one end and having another end free.\nThe cart can be pushed left or right, and the goal is to balance the pole on the top of the cart by applying forces on the cart.\nMore information on the environment could be found at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_pendulum/\n\n**Training Objectives**: To balance the pole (inverted pendulum) on top of the cart\n\n**Actions**: The agent takes a 1D vector for actions. The action space is a continuous ``(action)`` in ``[-3, 3]``,\nwhere action represents the numerical force applied to the cart\n(with magnitude representing the amount of force and sign representing the direction)\n\n**Approach**: We use PyTorch to code REINFORCE from scratch to train a Neural Network policy to master Inverted Pendulum.\n\nAn explanation of the Gymnasium v0.26+ `Env.step()` function\n\n``env.step(A)`` allows us to take an action 'A' in the current environment 'env'. The environment then executes the action\nand returns five variables:\n\n - ``next_obs``: This is the observation that the agent will receive after taking the action.\n - ``reward``: This is the reward that the agent will receive after taking the action.\n - ``terminated``: This is a boolean variable that indicates whether or not the environment has terminated.\n - ``truncated``: This is a boolean variable that also indicates whether the episode ended by early truncation, i.e., a time limit is reached.\n - ``info``: This is a dictionary that might contain additional information about the environment.\n"

It consists of 2 linear layers that are shared between both the predicted mean and standard deviation.\nFurther, the single individual linear layers are used to estimate the mean and the standard deviation. ``nn.Tanh`` is used as a non-linearity between the hidden layers.\nThe following function estimates a mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution from which an action is sampled. Hence it is expected for the policy to learn\nappropriate weights to output means and standard deviation based on the current observation.\n\n"
