## Toy Text

```{toctree}
:hidden:

toy_text/blackjack.md
toy_text/taxi.md
toy_text/cliff_walking.md
toy_text/frozen_lake.md
```

```{raw} html
   :file: toy_text/list.html
```

All toy text environments were created by us using native Python libraries such as StringIO.

These environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. As a result, they are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.

All environments are configurable via arguments specified in each environment's documentation.
