### Description
The easiest control task to learn from pixels - a top-down
racing environment. The generated track is random every episode.

Some indicators are shown at the bottom of the window along with the
state RGB buffer. From left to right: true speed, four ABS sensors,
steering wheel position, and gyroscope.
To play yourself (it's rather fast for humans), type:
```
python gymnasium/envs/box2d/car_racing.py
```
Remember: it's a powerful rear-wheel drive car - don't press the accelerator
and turn at the same time.

### Action Space
If continuous:
    There are 3 actions: steering (-1 is full left, +1 is full right), gas, and breaking.
If discrete:
    There are 5 actions: do nothing, steer left, steer right, gas, brake.

### Observation Space
State consists of 96x96 pixels.

### Rewards
The reward is -0.1 every frame and +1000/N for every track tile visited,
where N is the total number of tiles visited in the track. For example,
if you have finished in 732 frames, your reward is
1000 - 0.1*732 = 926.8 points.

### Starting State
The car starts at rest in the center of the road.

### Episode Termination
The episode finishes when all of the tiles are visited. The car can also go
outside of the playfield - that is, far off the track, in which case it will
receive -100 reward and die.

### Arguments
`lap_complete_percent` dictates the percentage of tiles that must be visited by
the agent before a lap is considered complete.

Passing `domain_randomize=True` enables the domain randomized variant of the environment.
In this scenario, the background and track colours are different on every reset.

Passing `continuous=False` converts the environment to use discrete action space.
The discrete action space has 5 actions: [do nothing, left, right, gas, brake].

### Reset Arguments
Passing the option `options["randomize"] = True` will change the current colour of the environment on demand.
Correspondingly, passing the option `options["randomize"] = False` will not change the current colour of the environment.
`domain_randomize` must be `True` on init for this argument to work.
Example usage:
```py
    env = gymnasium.make("CarRacing-v1", domain_randomize=True)

    # normal reset, this changes the colour scheme by default
    env.reset()

    # reset with colour scheme change
    env.reset(options={"randomize": True})

    # reset with no colour scheme change
    env.reset(options={"randomize": False})
```

### Version History
