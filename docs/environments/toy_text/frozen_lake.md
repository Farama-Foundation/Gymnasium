Frozen lake involves crossing a frozen lake from Start(S) to Goal(G) without falling into any Holes(H)
by walking over the Frozen(F) lake.
The agent may not always move in the intended direction due to the slippery nature of the frozen lake.


### Action Space
The agent takes a 1-element vector for actions.
The action space is `(dir)`, where `dir` decides direction to move in which can be:

- 0: LEFT
- 1: DOWN
- 2: RIGHT
- 3: UP

### Observation Space
The observation is a value representing the agent's current position as
current_row * nrows + current_col (where both the row and col start at 0).
For example, the goal position in the 4x4 map can be calculated as follows: 3 * 4 + 3 = 15.
The number of possible observations is dependent on the size of the map.
For example, the 4x4 map has 16 possible observations.

### Rewards

Reward schedule:
- Reach goal(G): +1
- Reach hole(H): 0
- Reach frozen(F): 0

### Arguments

```
gymnasium.make('FrozenLake-v1', desc=None, map_name="4x4", is_slippery=True)
```

`desc`: Used to specify custom map for frozen lake. For example,

    desc=["SFFF", "FHFH", "FFFH", "HFFG"].

    A random generated map can be specified by calling the function `generate_random_map`. For example,

    ```
    from gymnasium.envs.toy_text.frozen_lake import generate_random_map

    gymnasium.make('FrozenLake-v1', desc=generate_random_map(size=8))
    ```

`map_name`: ID to use any of the preloaded maps.

    "4x4":[
        "SFFF",
        "FHFH",
        "FFFH",
        "HFFG"
        ]

    "8x8": [
        "SFFFFFFF",
        "FFFFFFFF",
        "FFFHFFFF",
        "FFFFFHFF",
        "FFFHFFFF",
        "FHHFFFHF",
        "FHFFHFHF",
        "FFFHFFFG",
    ]

`is_slippery`: True/False. If True will move in intended direction with
probability of 1/3 else will move in either perpendicular direction with
equal probability of 1/3 in both directions.

    For example, if action is left and is_slippery is True, then:
    - P(move left)=1/3
    - P(move up)=1/3
    - P(move down)=1/3
