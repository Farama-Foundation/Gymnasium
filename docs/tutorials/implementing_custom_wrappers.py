Implementing Custom Wrappers
============================

In this tutorial we will describe how to implement your own custom wrappers.
Wrappers are a great way to add functionality to your environments in a modular way.
This will save you a lot of boilerplate code.

We will show how to create a wrapper by

- Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.ObservationWrapper`
- Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.ActionWrapper`
- Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.RewardWrapper`
- Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.Wrapper`

Before following this tutorial, make sure to check out the docs of the :mod:`gymnasium.wrappers` module.

# %%
# Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.ObservationWrapper`
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Observation wrappers are useful if you want to apply some function to the observations that are returned
# by an environment. If you implement an observation wrapper, you only need to define this transformation
# by implementing the :meth:`gymnasium.ObservationWrapper.observation` method. Moreover, you should remember to
# update the observation space, if the transformation changes the shape of observations (e.g. by transforming
# dictionaries into numpy arrays, as in the following example).
#
# Imagine you have a 2D navigation task where the environment returns dictionaries as observations with
# keys ``"agent_position"`` and ``"target_position"``. A common thing to do might be to throw away some degrees of
# freedom and only consider the position of the target relative to the agent, i.e.
# ``observation["target_position"] - observation["agent_position"]``. For this, you could implement an
# observation wrapper like this:

import numpy as np
from gym import ActionWrapper, ObservationWrapper, RewardWrapper, Wrapper

import gymnasium as gym
from gymnasium.spaces import Box, Discrete


class RelativePosition(ObservationWrapper):
    def __init__(self, env):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.observation_space = Box(shape=(2,), low=-np.inf, high=np.inf)

    def observation(self, obs):
        return obs["target"] - obs["agent"]


# %%
# Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.ActionWrapper`
# ------------------------------------------------
# Action wrappers can be used to apply a transformation to actions before applying them to the environment.
# If you implement an action wrapper, you need to define that transformation by implementing
# :meth:`gymnasium.ActionWrapper.action`. Moreover, you should specify the domain of that transformation
# by updating the action space of the wrapper.
#
# Letâ€™s say you have an environment with action space of type :class:`gymnasium.spaces.Box`, but you would only like
# to use a finite subset of actions. Then, you might want to implement the following wrapper:


class DiscreteActions(ActionWrapper):
    def __init__(self, env, disc_to_cont):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.disc_to_cont = disc_to_cont
        self.action_space = Discrete(len(disc_to_cont))

    def action(self, act):
        return self.disc_to_cont[act]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = gym.make("LunarLanderContinuous-v2")
    wrapped_env = DiscreteActions(
        env, [np.array([1, 0]), np.array([-1, 0]), np.array([0, 1]), np.array([0, -1])]
    )
    print(wrapped_env.action_space)  # Discrete(4)


# %%
# Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.RewardWrapper`
# ------------------------------------------------
# Reward wrappers are used to transform the reward that is returned by an environment.
# As for the previous wrappers, you need to specify that transformation by implementing the
# :meth:`gymnasium.RewardWrapper.reward` method. Also, you might want to update the reward range of the wrapper.
#
# Let us look at an example: Sometimes (especially when we do not have control over the reward
# because it is intrinsic), we want to clip the reward to a range to gain some numerical stability.
# To do that, we could, for instance, implement the following wrapper:

from typing import SupportsFloat


class ClipReward(RewardWrapper):
    def __init__(self, env, min_reward, max_reward):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.min_reward = min_reward
        self.max_reward = max_reward
        self.reward_range = (min_reward, max_reward)

    def reward(self, r: SupportsFloat) -> SupportsFloat:
        return np.clip(r, self.min_reward, self.max_reward)


# %%
# Inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.Wrapper`
# ------------------------------------------
# Sometimes you might need to implement a wrapper that does some more complicated modifications (e.g. modify the
# reward based on data in ``info`` or change the rendering behavior).
# Such wrappers can be implemented by inheriting from :class:`gymnasium.Wrapper`.
#
# - You can set a new action or observation space by defining ``self.action_space`` or ``self.observation_space`` in ``__init__``, respectively
# - You can set new metadata and reward range by defining ``self.metadata`` and ``self.reward_range`` in ``__init__``, respectively
# - You can override :meth:`gymnasium.Wrapper.step`, :meth:`gymnasium.Wrapper.render`, :meth:`gymnasium.Wrapper.close` etc.
# If you do this, you can access the environment that was passed
# to your wrapper (which *still* might be wrapped in some other wrapper) by accessing the attribute :attr:`env`.
#
# Let's also take a look at an example for this case. Most MuJoCo environments return a reward that consists
# of different terms: For instance, there might be a term that rewards the agent for completing the task and one term that
# penalizes large actions (i.e. energy usage). Usually, you can pass weight parameters for those terms during
# initialization of the environment. However, *Reacher* does not allow you to do this! Nevertheless, all individual terms
# of the reward are returned in `info`, so let us build a wrapper for Reacher that allows us to weight those terms:


class ReacherRewardWrapper(Wrapper):
    def __init__(self, env, reward_dist_weight, reward_ctrl_weight):
        super().__init__(env)
        self.reward_dist_weight = reward_dist_weight
        self.reward_ctrl_weight = reward_ctrl_weight

    def step(self, action):
        obs, _, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
        reward = (
            self.reward_dist_weight * info["reward_dist"]
            + self.reward_ctrl_weight * info["reward_ctrl"]
        )
        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info
