Tutorials
=========

We provide two sets of tutorials: basics and training.

* The aim of the basics tutorials is to showcase the fundamental API of Gymnasium to help users implement it
* The most common application of Gymnasium is for training RL agents, the training tutorials aim to show a range of example implementations for different environments

Additionally, we provide the third party tutorials as a link for external projects that utilise Gymnasium that could help users.
