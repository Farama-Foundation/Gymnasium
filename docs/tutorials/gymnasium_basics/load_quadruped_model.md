Load custom quadruped robot environments
================================

In this tutorial we will see how to use the `MuJoCo/Ant-v5` framework to create a quadruped walking environment, using a model file (ending in `.xml`) without having to create a new class.

Steps:

0. Get your **MJCF** (or **URDF**) model file of your robot.
	- Create your own model (see the [Guide](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/m22odeling.html)) or,
	- Find a ready-made model (in this tutorial, we will use a model from the [**MuJoCo Menagerie**](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) collection).
1. Load the model with the `xml_file` argument.
2. Tweak the environment parameters to get the desired behavior.
 	1. Tweak the environment simulation parameters.
	2. Tweak the environment termination parameters.
	3. Tweak the environment reward parameters.
	4. Tweak the environment observation parameters.
3. Train an agent to move your robot.


The reader is expected to be familiar with the `Gymnasium` API & library, the basics of robotics, and the included `Gymnasium/MuJoCo` environments with the robot model they use. Familiarity with the **MJCF** file model format and the `MuJoCo` simulator is not required but is recommended.

Setup
------
We will need `gymnasium>=1.0.0`.

```sh
pip install "gymnasium>=1.0.0"
```

Step 0.1 - Download a Robot Model
-------------------------
In this tutorial we will load the [Unitree Go1](
https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/blob/main/unitree_go1/README.md) robot from the excellent [MuJoCo Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) robot model collection.
![Unitree Go1 robot in a flat terrain scene](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie/blob/main/unitree_go1/go1.png?raw=true)

`Go1` is a quadruped robot, controlling it to move is a significant learning problem, much harder than the `Gymnasium/MuJoCo/Ant` environment.

We can download the whole MuJoCo Menagerie collection (which includes `Go1`),
```sh
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie.git
```
You can use any other quadruped robot with this tutorial, just adjust the environment parameter values for your robot.


Step 1 - Load the model
-------------------------
To load the model, all we have to do is use the `xml_file` argument with the `Ant-v5` framework.

```py
import gymnasium
import numpy as np
env = gymnasium.make('Ant-v5', xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml')
```

Although this is enough to load the model, we will need to tweak some environment parameters to get the desired behavior for our environment, for now we will also explicitly set the simulation, termination, reward and observation arguments, which we will tweak in the next step.

```py
env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=0,
    ctrl_cost_weight=0,
    contact_cost_weight=0,
    healthy_reward=0,
    main_body=1,
    healthy_z_range=(0, np.inf),
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,
    reset_noise_scale=0,
    frame_skip=1,
    max_episode_steps=1000,
)
```


Step 2 - Tweaking the Environment Parameters
-------------------------
Tweaking the environment parameters is essential to get the desired behavior for learning.
In the following subsections, the reader is encouraged to consult the [documentation of the arguments](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/environments/mujoco/ant/#arguments) for more detailed information.



Step 2.1 - Tweaking the Environment Simulation Parameters
-------------------------
The arguments of interest are `frame_skip`, `reset_noise_scale` and `max_episode_steps`.

We want to tweak the `frame_skip` parameter to get `dt` to an acceptable value (typical values are `dt` $\in [0.01, 0.1]$ seconds),

Reminder: $dt = frame\_skip \times model.opt.timestep$, where `model.opt.timestep` is the integrator time step selected in the MJCF model file.

The `Go1` model we are using has an integrator timestep of `0.002`, so by selecting `frame_skip=25` we can set the value of `dt` to `0.05s`.

To avoid overfitting the policy, `reset_noise_scale` should be set to a value appropriate to the size of the robot, we want the value to be as large as possible without the initial distribution of states being invalid (`Terminal` regardless of control actions), for `Go1` we choose a value of `0.1`.

And `max_episode_steps` determines the number of steps per episode before `truncation`, here we set it to 1000 to be consistent with the based `Gymnasium/MuJoCo` environments, but if you need something higher you can set it so.


```py
env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=0,
    ctrl_cost_weight=0,
    contact_cost_weight=0,
    healthy_reward=0,
    main_body=1,
    healthy_z_range=(0, np.inf),
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,
    reset_noise_scale=0.1,  # set to avoid policy overfitting
    frame_skip=25,  # set dt=0.05
    max_episode_steps=1000,  # kept at 1000
)
```


Step 2.2 - Tweaking the Environment Termination Parameters
-------------------------
Termination is important for robot environments to avoid sampling "useless" time steps.

The arguments of interest are `terminate_when_unhealthy` and `healthy_z_range`.

We want to set `healthy_z_range` to terminate the environment when the robot falls over, or jumps really high, here we have to choose a value that is logical for the height of the robot, for `Go1` we choose `(0.195, 0.75)`.
Note: `healthy_z_range` checks the absolute value of the height of the robot, so if your scene contains different levels of elevation it should be set to `(-np.inf, np.inf)`

We could also set `terminate_when_unhealthy=False` to disable termination altogether, which is not desirable in the case of `Go1`.

```py
env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=0,
    ctrl_cost_weight=0,
    contact_cost_weight=0,
    healthy_reward=0,
    main_body=1,
    healthy_z_range=(0.195, 0.75),  # set to avoid sampling steps where the robot has fallen or jumped too high
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,
    reset_noise_scale=0.1,
    frame_skip=25,
    max_episode_steps=1000,
)
```

Note: If you need a different termination condition, you can write your own `TerminationWrapper` (see the  [documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/api/wrappers/)).



Step 2.3 - Tweaking the Environment Reward Parameters
-------------------------
The arguments of interest are `forward_reward_weight`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `contact_cost_weight`, `healthy_reward`, and `main_body`.

For the arguments `forward_reward_weight`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `contact_cost_weight` and `healthy_reward` we have to pick values that make sense for our robot, you can use the default `MuJoCo/Ant` parameters for references and tweak them if a change is needed for your environment. In the case of `Go1` we only change the `ctrl_cost_weight` since it has a higher actuator force range.

For the argument `main_body` we have to choose which body part is the main body (usually called something like "torso" or "trunk" in the model file) for the calculation of the `forward_reward`, in the case of `Go1` it is the `"trunk"` (Note: in most cases including this one, it can be left at the default value).

```py
env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=1,  # kept the same as the 'Ant' environment
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.05,  # changed because of the stronger motors of `Go1`
    contact_cost_weight=5e-4,  # kept the same as the 'Ant' environment
    healthy_reward=1,  # kept the same as the 'Ant' environment
    main_body=1,  # represents the "trunk" of the `Go1` robot
    healthy_z_range=(0.195, 0.75),
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,
    reset_noise_scale=0.1,
    frame_skip=25,
    max_episode_steps=1000,
)
```

Note: If you need a different reward function, you can write your own `RewardWrapper` (see the [documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/api/wrappers/reward_wrappers/)).



Step 2.4 - Tweaking the Environment Observation Parameters
-------------------------
The arguments of interest are `include_cfrc_ext_in_observation` and `exclude_current_positions_from_observation`.

Here for `Go1` we have no particular reason to change them.

```py
env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=1,
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.05,
    contact_cost_weight=5e-4,
    healthy_reward=1,
    main_body=1,
    healthy_z_range=(0.195, 0.75),
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,  # kept the game as the 'Ant' environment
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,  # kept the game as the 'Ant' environment
    reset_noise_scale=0.1,
    frame_skip=25,
    max_episode_steps=1000,
)
```


Note: If you need additional observation elements (such as additional sensors), you can write your own `ObservationWrapper` (see the [documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/main/api/wrappers/observation_wrappers/)).



Step 3 - Train your Agent
-------------------------
Finally, we are done, we can use a RL algorithm to train an agent to walk/run the `Go1` robot.
Note: If you have followed this guide with your own robot model, you may discover during training that some environment parameters were not as desired, feel free to go back to step 2 and change anything as needed.

```py
import gymnasium

env = gymnasium.make(
    'Ant-v5',
    xml_file='./mujoco_menagerie/unitree_go1/scene.xml',
    forward_reward_weight=1,
    ctrl_cost_weight=0.05,
    contact_cost_weight=5e-4,
    healthy_reward=1,
    main_body=1,
    healthy_z_range=(0.195, 0.75),
    include_cfrc_ext_in_observation=True,
    exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False,
    reset_noise_scale=0.1,
    frame_skip=25,
    max_episode_steps=1000,
)
... # run your RL algorithm
```
