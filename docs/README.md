# Gymnasium-docs

This folder contains the documentation for [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium).

If you are modifying an atari environment page, please follow the instructions below. For more information about how to contribute to the documentation go to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Celshast/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Instructions for modifying environment pages

### Editing an environment page

If you are editing an Atari environment, directly edit the Markdown file in this repository.

Otherwise, fork Gymnasium and edit the docstring in the environment's Python file. Then, pip install your Gymnasium fork and run `docs/_scripts/gen_mds.py` in this repo. This will automatically generate a Markdown documentation file for the environment.

### Adding a new environment

#### Atari env

For Atari envs, add a Markdown file into `docs/environments/atari` then complete the [other steps](#other-steps).

#### Non-Atari env

Ensure the environment is in Gymnasium (or your fork). Ensure that the environment's Python file has a properly formatted markdown docstring. Install using `pip install -e .` and then run `docs/_scripts/gen_mds.py`. This will automatically generate a md page for the environment. Then complete the [other steps](#other-steps).

#### Other steps

- Add the corresponding gif into the `docs/_static/videos/{ENV_TYPE}` folder, where `ENV_TYPE` is the category of your new environment (e.g. mujoco). Follow snake_case naming convention. Alternatively, run `docs/_scripts/gen_gifs.py`.
- Edit `docs/environments/{ENV_TYPE}/index.md`, and add the name of the file corresponding to your new environment to the `toctree`.

## Build the Documentation

Install the required packages and Gymnasium (or your fork):

```
pip install gymnasium
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

To build the documentation once:

```
cd docs
make dirhtml
```

To rebuild the documentation automatically every time a change is made:

```
cd docs
sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml . _build
```

## Writing Tutorials

We use Sphinx-Gallery to build the tutorials inside the `docs/tutorials` directory. Check `docs/tutorials/demo.py` to see an example of a tutorial and [Sphinx-Gallery documentation](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/syntax.html) for more information.

To convert Jupyter Notebooks to the python tutorials you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/mgoulao/f07f5f79f6cd9a721db8a34bba0a19a7).

If you want Sphinx-Gallery to execute the tutorial (which adds outputs and plots) then the file name should start with `run_`. Note that this adds to the build time so make sure the script doesn't take more than a few seconds to execute.
