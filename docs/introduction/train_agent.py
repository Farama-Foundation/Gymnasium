# In this tutorial, we’ll explore and solve the *Blackjack-v1*
# environment.
#
# **Blackjack** is one of the most popular casino card games that is also
# infamous for being beatable under certain conditions. This version of
# the game uses an infinite deck (we draw the cards with replacement), so
# counting cards won’t be a viable strategy in our simulated game.
# Full documentation can be found at https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack
#
# **Objective**: To win, your card sum should be greater than the
# dealers without exceeding 21.
#
# **Actions**: Agents can pick between two actions:
#  - stand (0): the player takes no more cards
#  - hit (1): the player will be given another card, however the player could get over 21 and bust
#
# **Approach**: To solve this environment by yourself, you can pick your
# favorite discrete RL algorithm. The presented solution uses *Q-learning*
# (a model-free RL algorithm).

import gymnasium as gym


# Let's start by creating the blackjack environment.
# Note: We are going to follow the rules from Sutton & Barto.
# Other versions of the game can be found below for you to experiment.

env = gym.make("Blackjack-v1", sab=True)

# %%
# .. code:: py
#
#   # Other possible environment configurations are:
#
#   env = gym.make('Blackjack-v1', natural=True, sab=False)
#   # Whether to give an additional reward for starting with a natural blackjack, i.e. starting with an ace and ten (sum is 21).
#
#   env = gym.make('Blackjack-v1', natural=False, sab=False)
#   # Whether to follow the exact rules outlined in the book by Sutton and Barto. If `sab` is `True`, the keyword argument `natural` will be ignored.
#


# %%
# Observing the environment
# ------------------------------
#
# First of all, we call ``env.reset()`` to start an episode. This function
# resets the environment to a starting position and returns an initial
# ``observation``. We usually also set ``done = False``. This variable
# will be useful later to check if a game is terminated (i.e., the player wins or loses).
#

# reset the environment to get the first observation
done = False
observation, info = env.reset()

# observation = (16, 9, False)


# %%
# Note that our observation is a 3-tuple consisting of 3 values:
#
# -  The players current sum
# -  Value of the dealers face-up card
# -  Boolean whether the player holds a usable ace (An ace is usable if it
#    counts as 11 without busting)
#


# %%
# Executing an action
# ------------------------------
#
# After receiving our first observation, we are only going to use the
# ``env.step(action)`` function to interact with the environment. This
# function takes an action as input and executes it in the environment.
# Because that action changes the state of the environment, it returns
# four useful variables to us. These are:
#
# -  ``next_state``: This is the observation that the agent will receive
#    after taking the action.
# -  ``reward``: This is the reward that the agent will receive after
#    taking the action.
# -  ``terminated``: This is a boolean variable that indicates whether or
#    not the environment has terminated.
# -  ``truncated``: This is a boolean variable that also indicates whether
#    the episode ended by early truncation, i.e., a time limit is reached.
# -  ``info``: This is a dictionary that might contain additional
#    information about the environment.
#
# The ``next_state``, ``reward``,  ``terminated`` and ``truncated`` variables are
# self-explanatory, but the ``info`` variable requires some additional
# explanation. This variable contains a dictionary that might have some
# extra information about the environment, but in the Blackjack-v1
# environment you can ignore it. For example in Atari environments the
# info dictionary has a ``ale.lives`` key that tells us how many lives the
# agent has left. If the agent has 0 lives, then the episode is over.
#
# Note that it is not a good idea to call ``env.render()`` in your training
# loop because rendering slows down training by a lot. Rather try to build
# an extra loop to evaluate and showcase the agent after training.
#

# sample a random action from all valid actions
action = env.action_space.sample()
# action=1

# execute the action in our environment and receive infos from the environment
observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

# observation=(24, 10, False)
# reward=-1.0
# terminated=True
# truncated=False
# info={}


# %%
# Once ``terminated = True`` or ``truncated=True``, we should stop the
# current episode and begin a new one with ``env.reset()``. If you
# continue executing actions without resetting the environment, it still
# responds but the output won’t be useful for training (it might even be
# harmful if the agent learns on invalid data).
#


# %%
# Building an agent
# ------------------------------
#
# Let’s build a ``Q-learning agent`` to solve *Blackjack-v1*! We’ll need
# some functions for picking an action and updating the agents action
# values. To ensure that the agents explores the environment, one possible
# solution is the ``epsilon-greedy`` strategy, where we pick a random
# action with the percentage ``epsilon`` and the greedy action (currently
# valued as the best) ``1 - epsilon``.

# Think you can do better?
# ------------------------------

# You can visualize the environment using the play function
# and try to win a few games.


# %%
# Hopefully this Tutorial helped you get a grip of how to interact with
# OpenAI-Gym environments and sets you on a journey to solve many more RL
# challenges.
#
# It is recommended that you solve this environment by yourself (project
# based learning is really effective!). You can apply your favorite
# discrete RL algorithm or give Monte Carlo ES a try (covered in `Sutton &
# Barto <http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html>`_, section
# 5.3) - this way you can compare your results directly to the book.
#
# Best of fun!
