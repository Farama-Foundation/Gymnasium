Gymnasium is a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s Gym library. It provides a user-friendly, pythonic interface for creating and interacting with reinforcement learning environments. With Gymnasium, you can access a diverse collection of environments, as well as represent your own custom RL environments. If you require an environment that is only available in the old Gym, you can use the [compatibility wrapper](content/gym_compatibility).

Here is a minimal code example to run an environment:

```{code-block} python
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1", render_mode="human")
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42) # get the first observation

for step in range(1000):
    # here you can use your policy to get an action based on the observation
    action = env.action_space.sample()

    # execute the action in the environment
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```
