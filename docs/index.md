**Gymnasium is a maintained fork of OpenAIâ€™s Gym library. The Gymnasium interface is simple, pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems, and has a [compatibility wrapper](content/gym_compatibility
) for old Gym environments:**

```{code-block} python

import gymnasium as gym
env = gym.make("LunarLander-v2", render_mode="human")
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)
for _ in range(1000):
   action = env.action_space.sample()  # this is where you would insert your policy
   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

   if terminated or truncated:
      observation, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```
