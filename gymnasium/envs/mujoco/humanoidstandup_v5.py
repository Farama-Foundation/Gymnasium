class HumanoidStandupEnv(MujocoEnv, utils.EzPickle):

    ## Description
    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and Todorov
    in ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).
    The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen) with a
    pair of legs and arms. The legs each consist of two links, and so the arms (representing the
    knees and elbows respectively). The environment starts with the humanoid laying on the ground,
    and then the goal of the environment is to make the humanoid standup and then keep it standing
    by applying torques on the various hinges.

    Gymnasium includes the following versions of the environment:

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (17,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space
    The observation space consists of the following parts (in order)

    - qpos (22 elements by default):* The position values of the robot's body parts.
    - qvel (23 elements):* The velocities of these individual body parts,
    (their derivatives).
    - *cinert (130 elements):* Mass and inertia of the rigid body parts relative to the center of mass,
    (this is an intermediate result of the transition).
    It has shape 13*10 (*nbody * 10*).
    (cinert - inertia matrix and body mass offset and body mass)
    - *cvel (78 elements):* Center of mass based velocity.
    It has shape 13 * 6 (*nbody * 6*).
    (com velocity - velocity x, y, z and angular velocity x, y, z)
    - *qfrc_actuator (17 elements):* Constraint force generated as the actuator force at each joint.
    This has shape `(17,)`  *(nv * 1)*.
    - *cfrc_ext (78 elements):* This is the center of mass based external force on the body parts.
    It has shape 13 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and thus adds to another 78 elements in the observation space.
    (external forces - force x, y, z and torque x, y, z)

    where *nbody* is for the number of bodies in the robot
    and *nv* is for the number of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*).

    By default, the observation does not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    These can be be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In this case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (350,), float64)`, where the first two observations are the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` is set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates are returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    By default, however, the observation space is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (348,), float64)`, where the position and velocity elements are as follows:

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the
    [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).

    **Note:**
    When using Humanoid-v3 or earlier versions, problems have been reported when using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0.
    results in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py
    version < 2.0 when using the Humanoid environment if you would like to report results
    with contact forces (if contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use
    version > 2.0).


    ## Rewards
    The total reward is: ***reward*** *=* *uph_cost + 1 - quad_ctrl_cost - quad_impact_cost*.

    - *uph_cost*:
    A reward for moving up (trying to stand up).
    This is not a relative reward, measuring how far up it has moved since the last timestep,
    but it is an absolute reward that measures how much upward the Humanoid has moved up in total.
    It is measured as $weight_{uph} \times (z_{after action} - 0)/dt$,
    where $z_{after action}$ is the z coordinate of the torso after taking an action,
    and *dt* is the time between actions, and depends on the `frame_skip` parameter
    (default is 5), where the frametime is 0.003 - so the default is *dt = 5 * 0.003 = 0.015*.
    and $weight_{uph}$ is `uph_cost_weight`.
    - *quad_ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Humanoid for taking actions that are too large.
    $w_{quad_control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{quad_control}$ is `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.1$).
    If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the control has shape  `nu x 1`.
    - *impact_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Humanoid if the external contact forces are too large.
    $w_{impact} \times clamp(impact\\_cost\\_range, \\|F_{contact}\\|_2^2)$, where
    $w_{impact}$ is `impact_cost_weight` (default is $5\times10^{-7}$),
    $F_{contact}$ are the external contact forces (see `cfrc_ext` section on observation).

    `info` contains the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    The initial position state is $[0.0, 0.0, 1.4, 1.0, 0.0, ... 0.0] + \mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{24}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{24}]}$.
    The initial velocity state is $0_{23} + \mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{23}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{23}]}$.

    where $\mathcal{U}$ is the multivariate uniform continuous distribution.

    Note that the z- and x-coordinates are non-zero so that the humanoid immediately lies down and faces forward (x-axis).


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Humanoid never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps


    ## Arguments
    HumanoidStandup provides a range of parameters to modify the observation space, reward function, initial state, and termination condition.
    These parameters can be applied during `gymnasium.make` in the following way:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('HumanoidStandup-v5', impact_cost_weight=0.5e-6, ....)
    ```

    ## Version History
    * v5:
        - Minimum `mujoco` version is now 2.3.3.
        - Added support for fully custom/third party `mujoco` models using the `xml_file` argument (previously only a few changes could be made to the existing models).
        - Added `default_camera_config` argument, a dictionary for setting the `mj_camera` properties, mainly useful for custom environments.
        - Added `env.observation_structure`, a dictionary for specifying the observation space compose (e.g. `qpos`, `qvel`), useful for building tooling and wrappers for the MuJoCo environments.
        - Return a non-empty `info` with `reset()`, previously an empty dictionary was returned, the new keys are the same state information as `step()`.
        - Added `frame_skip` argument, used to configure the `dt` (duration of `step()`), default varies by environment check environment documentation pages.
        - Excluded the `cinert` & `cvel` & `cfrc_ext` of `worldbody` and `root`/`freejoint` `qfrc_actuator` from the observation space, as it was always 0, and thus provided no useful information to the agent, resulting in slightly faster training) (related [Github issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/204)).
        - Restored the `xml_file` argument (was removed in `v4`).
        - Added `xml_file` argument.
        - Added `uph_cost_weight`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `impact_cost_weight`, `impact_cost_range` arguments, to configure the reward function (defaults are effectively the same as in `v4`).
        - Added `reset_noise_scale` argument, to set the range of initial states.
        - Added `include_cinert_in_observation`, `include_cvel_in_observation`, `include_qfrc_actuator_in_observation`, `include_cfrc_ext_in_observation` arguments to allow for the exclusion of observation elements from the observation space.
        - Added `info["tendon_length"]` and `info["tendon_velocity"]` containing observations of the Humanoid's 2 tendons connecting the hips to the knees.
        - Added `info["x_position"]` & `info["y_position"]` , which contain the observations excluded when `exclude_current_positions_from_observation == True`.
        - Added `info["z_distance_from_origin"]` which is equal to the vertical distance of the "torso" body from its initial position.
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3.
    * v3: This environment does not have a v3 release.
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50.
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0).
