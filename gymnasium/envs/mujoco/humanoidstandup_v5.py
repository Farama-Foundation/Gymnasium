    ## Description
    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and Todorov
    in ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).
    The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen) with a
    pair of legs and arms. The legs each consist of two links, and so the arms (representing the
    knees and elbows respectively). The environment starts with the humanoid laying on the ground,
    and then the goal of the environment is to make the humanoid standup and then keep it standing
    by applying torques on the various hinges.


    ## Action Space
    The agent take a 17-element vector for actions.

    The action space is a continuous `(action, ...)` all in `[-1, 1]`, where `action`
    represents the numerical torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space
    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the
    positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso. These may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (350,), float64)` where the first two observations
    represent the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates
    will be returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (348,), float64)`. The elements correspond to the following:

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
    the observation contains (in order):
    - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of mass
    (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 13*10 (*nbody * 10*)
    and hence adds to another 130 elements in the state space.
    - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 13 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence
    adds another 78 elements in the state space
    - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has shape
    `(17,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 17 elements to the state space.
    - *cfrc_ext:* This is the center of mass based external force on the body.  It has shape
    13 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 78 elements in the state space.
    where *nbody* stands for the number of bodies in the robot and *nv* stands for the
    number of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*)

    The body parts are:

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the
    [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).

    **Note:** Humanoid-v4 environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.
    If using previous Humanoid versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0
    results in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py
    version < 2.0 when using the Humanoid environment if you would like to report results
    with contact forces (if contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use
    version > 2.0).


    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of three parts:
    - *uph_cost*:
    A reward for moving upward (in an attempt to stand up).
    This is not a relative reward which measures how much upward it has moved from the last timestep,
    but it is an absolute reward which measures how much upward the Humanoid has moved overall.
    It is measured as $weight_{uph} \times (z_{after action} - 0)/dt$,
    where $z_{after action}$ is the z coordinate of the torso after taking an action,
    and *dt* is the time between actions and is dependent on the `frame_skip` parameter
    (default is 5), where the frametime is 0.003 - making the default *dt = 5 * 0.003 = 0.015*.
    and $weight_{uph}$ is `uph_cost_weight`.
    - *quad_ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward for penalizing the Humanoid if it takes actions that are too large.
    $w_{quad_control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{quad_control}$ is `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.1$).
    If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the control has shape  `nu x 1`.
    - *impact_cost*:
    A negative reward for penalizing the Humanoid if the external contact forces are too large.
    $w_{impact} \times clamp(impact\\_cost\\_range, \\|F_{contact}\\|_2^2)$, where
    $w_{impact}$ is `impact_cost_weight` (default is $5\times10^{-7}$),
    $F_{contact}$ are the external contact forces (see `cfrc_ext` section on observation).

    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *uph_cost + 1 - quad_ctrl_cost - quad_impact_cost*,
    and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state
    (0.0, 0.0,  0.105, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range of
    [-0.01, 0.01] added to the positional and velocity values (values in the table)
    for stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected
    to be low, thereby indicating a laying down humanoid. The initial orientation is
    designed to make it face forward as well.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Humanoid never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The maximum duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps.

    `gymnasium.make` takes additional arguments such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc.
