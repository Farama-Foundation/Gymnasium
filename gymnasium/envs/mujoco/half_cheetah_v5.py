class HalfCheetahEnv(MujocoEnv, utils.EzPickle):
    r"""
    ## Description
    This environment is based on the work by P. WawrzyÅ„ski in
    ["A Cat-Like Robot Real-Time Learning to Run"](http://staff.elka.pw.edu.pl/~pwawrzyn/pub-s/0812_LSCLRR.pdf).
    The HalfCheetah is a 2-dimensional robot consisting of 9 body parts and 8
    joints connecting them (including two paws). The goal is to apply a torque
    on the joints to make the cheetah run forward (right) as fast as possible,
    with a positive reward allocated based on the distance moved forward and a
    negative reward allocated for moving backward. The torso and head of the
    cheetah are fixed, and the torque can only be applied on the other 6 joints
    over the front and back thighs (connecting to the torso), shins
    (connecting to the thighs) and feet (connecting to the shins).

    Gymnasium includes the following versions of the environment:

    | Environment               | Binding         | Notes                                       |

    For more information see section "Version History".


    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (6,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    | Num | Action                                  | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Type (Unit)  |
    | --- | --------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |

    | 1   | Torque applied on the back shin rotor   | -1          | 1           | bshin                            | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 2   | Torque applied on the back foot rotor   | -1          | 1           | bfoot                            | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 3   | Torque applied on the front thigh rotor | -1          | 1           | fthigh                           | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 4   | Torque applied on the front shin rotor  | -1          | 1           | fshin                            | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 5   | Torque applied on the front foot rotor  | -1          | 1           | ffoot                            | hinge | torque (N m) |


    ## Observation Space
    The observation Space consists of the following parts (in order):

    - qpos (8 elements by default):* Position values of the robots's body parts.
    - qvel (9 elements):* The velocities of these individual body parts,
    (their derivatives).

    By default, the observation does not include the robot's x-coordinate (`rootx`).
    This can be be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In this case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (18,), float64)`, where the first observation element is the x--coordinate of the robot.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` is set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates are returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (17,), float64)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Type (Unit)              |

    ## Rewards
    The total reward is: ***reward*** *=* *forward_reward - ctrl_cost*.

    - *forward_reward*:
    A reward for moving forward,
    this reward would be positive if the Half Cheetah moves forward (in the positive $x$ direction / in the right direction).
    $w_{forward} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$, where
    $dx$ is the displacement of the "tip" ($x_{after-action} - x_{before-action}$),
    $dt$ is the time between actions which is depends on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 5),
    and `frametime` which is 0.01 - so the default is $dt = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05$,
    $w_{forward}$ is the `forward_reward_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Half Cheetah for taking actions that are too large.
    $w_{control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{control}$ is the `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.1$).

    `info` contains the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    The initial position state is $\mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{9}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{9}]}$.
    The initial velocity state is $\mathcal{N}(0_{9}, reset\_noise\_scale^2 \times I_{9})$.

    where $\mathcal{N}$ is the multivariate normal distribution and $\mathcal{U}$ is the multivariate uniform continuous distribution.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Half Cheetah never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps


    ## Arguments
    HalfCheetah provides a range of parameters to modify the observation space, reward function, initial state, and termination condition.
    These parameters can be applied during `gymnasium.make` in the following way:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('HalfCheetah-v5', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ....)
    ```

    ## Version History
    * v5:
        - Minimum `mujoco` version is now 2.3.3.
        - Added support for fully custom/third party `mujoco` models using the `xml_file` argument (previously only a few changes could be made to the existing models).
        - Added `default_camera_config` argument, a dictionary for setting the `mj_camera` properties, mainly useful for custom environments.
        - Added `env.observation_structure`, a dictionary for specifying the observation space compose (e.g. `qpos`, `qvel`), useful for building tooling and wrappers for the MuJoCo environments.
        - Return a non-empty `info` with `reset()`, previously an empty dictionary was returned, the new keys are the same state information as `step()`.
        - Added `frame_skip` argument, used to configure the `dt` (duration of `step()`), default varies by environment check environment documentation pages.
        - Restored the `xml_file` argument (was removed in `v4`).
        - Renamed `info["reward_run"]` to `info["reward_forward"]` to be consistent with the other environments.
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3.
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen).
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50.
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
