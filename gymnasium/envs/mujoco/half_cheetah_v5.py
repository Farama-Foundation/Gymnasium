    ## Description
    This environment is based on the work by P. WawrzyÅ„ski in
    ["A Cat-Like Robot Real-Time Learning to Run"](http://staff.elka.pw.edu.pl/~pwawrzyn/pub-s/0812_LSCLRR.pdf).
    The HalfCheetah is a 2-dimensional robot consisting of 9 body parts and 8
    joints connecting them (including two paws). The goal is to apply a torque
    on the joints to make the cheetah run forward (right) as fast as possible,
    with a positive reward allocated based on the distance moved forward and a
    negative reward allocated for moving backward. The torso and head of the
    cheetah are fixed, and the torque can only be applied on the other 6 joints
    over the front and back thighs (connecting to the torso), shins
    (connecting to the thighs) and feet (connecting to the shins).


    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (6,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    | Num | Action                                  | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit         |

    | 2   | Torque applied on the back foot rotor   | -1          | 1           | bfoot                            | hinge | torque (N m) |

    | 4   | Torque applied on the front shin rotor  | -1          | 1           | fshin                            | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 5   | Torque applied on the front foot rotor  | -1          | 1           | ffoot                            | hinge | torque (N m) |


    ## Observation Space
    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the
    cheetah, followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the cheetah's `rootx`. It may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (18,), float64)` where the first element
    represents the `rootx`.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the
    will be returned in `info` with key `"x_position"`.

    However, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (17,), float64)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit                     |

    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of two parts:
    - *forward_reward*:
    A reward for moving forward,
    this reward would be positive if the Half Cheetah moves forward (in the positive $x$ direction / in the right direction).
    $w_{forward} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$, where
    $dx$ is the displacement of the "tip" ($x_{after-action} - x_{before-action}$),
    $dt$ is the time between actions which is depends on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 5),
    and `frametime` which is 0.01 - so the default is $dt = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05$,
    $w_{forward}$ is the `forward_reward_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Half Cheetah for taking actions that are too large.
    $w_{control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{control}$ is the `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.1$).

    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *forward_reward - ctrl_cost*,
    and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,) with a noise added to the
    initial state for stochasticity. As seen before, the first 8 values in the
    state are positional and the last 9 values are velocity. A uniform noise in
    the range of [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] is added to the positional values while a standard
    normal noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of `reset_noise_scale` is added to the
    initial velocity values of all zeros.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Half Cheetah never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The maximum duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps.


    ## Arguments
    `gymnasium.make` takes additional arguments such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('HalfCheetah-v5', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ....)

    ## Version History
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3.
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen).
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50.
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
