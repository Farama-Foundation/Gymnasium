    ## Description

    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and Todorov
    in ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).
    The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen) with a
    pair of legs and arms. The legs each consist of two links, and so the arms (representing the
    knees and elbows respectively). The environment starts with the humanoid laying on the ground,
    and then the goal of the environment is to make the humanoid standup and then keep it standing
    by applying torques on the various hinges.

    ## Action Space
    The agent take a 17-element vector for actions.

    The action space is a continuous `(action, ...)` all in `[-1, 1]`, where `action`
    represents the numerical torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space

    The state space consists of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.

    **Note:** The x- and y-coordinates of the torso are being omitted to produce position-agnostic behavior in policies

    The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(376,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
    the state_space consists of (in order):
    - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of mass
    (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10 (*nbody * 10*)
    and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
    - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence
    adds another 84 elements in the state space
    - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has shape
    `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state space.
    - *cfrc_ext:* This is the center of mass based external force on the body.  It has shape
    14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 84 elements in the state space.
    where *nbody* stands for the number of bodies in the robot and *nv* stands for the number
    of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*)

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the

    **Note:** HumanoidStandup-v4 environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.
    If using previous HumanoidStandup versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0 results
    in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py version < 2.0
    when using the Humanoid environment if you would like to report results with contact forces
    (if contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use version > 2.0).

    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of three parts:
    - *uph_cost*: A reward for moving upward (in an attempt to stand up). This is not a relative
    reward which measures how much upward it has moved from the last timestep, but it is an
    absolute reward which measures how much upward the Humanoid has moved overall. It is
    measured as *(z coordinate after action - 0)/(atomic timestep)*, where *z coordinate after
    action* is index 0 in the state/index 2 in the table, and *atomic timestep* is the time for
    one frame of movement even though the simulation has a framerate of 5 (done in order to inflate
    rewards a little for faster learning).
    - *quad_ctrl_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if it has too large of
    a control force. If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the control has shape  `nu x 1`.
    It is measured as *0.1 **x** sum(control<sup>2</sup>)*.
    - *quad_impact_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if the external
    contact force is too large. It is calculated as *min(0.5 * 0.000001 * sum(external
    contact force<sup>2</sup>), 10)*.

    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *uph_cost + 1 - quad_ctrl_cost - quad_impact_cost*

    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state
    (0.0, 0.0,  0.105, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range of
    [-0.01, 0.01] added to the positional and velocity values (values in the table)
    for stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected
    to be low, thereby indicating a laying down humanoid. The initial orientation is
    designed to make it face forward as well.

    ## Episode End
    The episode ends when any of the following happens:

    1. Truncation: The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
    2. Termination: Any of the state space values is no longer finite

    ## Arguments

    No additional arguments are currently supported.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('HumanoidStandup-v4')
    ```

    There is no v3 for HumanoidStandup, unlike the robot environments where a v3 and
    beyond take gymnasium.make kwargs such as xml_file, ctrl_cost_weight, reset_noise_scale etc.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('HumanoidStandup-v2')
    ```

    ## Version History

    * v4: all mujoco environments now use the mujoco bindings in mujoco>=2.1.3
    * v3: support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco_py >= 1.50
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
