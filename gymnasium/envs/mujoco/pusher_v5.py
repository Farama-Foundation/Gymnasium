class PusherEnv(MujocoEnv, utils.EzPickle):
    r"""
    ## Description
    "Pusher" is a multi-jointed robot arm that is very similar to a human arm.
    The goal is to move a target cylinder (called *object*) to a goal position using the robot's end effector (called *fingertip*).
    The robot consists of shoulder, elbow, forearm and wrist joints.


    ## Action Space
    ```{figure} action_space_figures/pusher.png
    :name: pusher
    ```

    The action space is a `Box(-2, 2, (7,), float32)`. An action `(a, b)` represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space
    The observation space consists of the following parts (in order):

    - *qpos (7 elements):* Position values of the robot's body parts.
    - *qvel (7 elements):* The velocities of these individual body parts (their derivatives).
    - *xpos (3 elements):* The coordinates of the fingertip of the pusher.
    - *xpos (3 elements):* The coordinates of the object to be moved.
    - *xpos (3 elements):* The coordinates of the goal position.

    The observation space is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (17,), float64)` where the elements are as follows:

    To understand the state space, an analogy can be drawn to a human arm, where the words "flex" and "roll" have the same meaning as in human joints.

    ## Rewards
    The total reward is: ***reward*** *=* *reward_dist + reward_ctrl + reward_near*.

    - *reward_near*:
    This reward is a measure of how far the *fingertip* of the pusher (the unattached end) is from the object,
    with a more negative value assigned for when the pusher's *fingertip* is further away from the target.
    It is $-w_{near} \|(P_{fingertip} - P_{target})\|_2$.
    where $w_{near}$ is the `reward_near_weight` (default is $0.5$).
    - *reward_dist*:
    This reward is a measure of how far the object is from the target goal position,
    with a more negative value assigned if the object is further away from the target.
    It is $-w_{dist} \|(P_{object} - P_{target})\|_2$.
    where $w_{dist}$ is the `reward_dist_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *reward_control*:
    A negative reward to penalize the pusher for taking actions that are too large.
    It is measured as the negative squared Euclidean norm of the action, i.e. as $-w_{control} \|action\|_2^2$.
    where $w_{control}$ is the `reward_control_weight` (default is $0.1$).

    `info` contains the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    The initial position state of the Pusher arm is $0_{6}$.
    The initial position state of the object is $\mathcal{U}_{[[-0.3, -0.2], [0, 0.2]]}$.
    The position state of the goal is (permanently) $[0.45, -0.05, -0.323]$.
    The initial velocity state of the Pusher arm is $\mathcal{U}_{[-0.005 \times I_{6}, 0.005 \times I_{6}]}$.
    The initial velocity state of the object is $0_2$.
    The velocity state of the goal is (permanently) $0_3$.

    where $\mathcal{U}$ is the multivariate uniform continuous distribution.

    Note that the initial position state of the object is sampled until its distance to the goal is $ > 0.17 m$.

    The default frame rate is 5, with each frame lasting 0.01, so *dt = 5 * 0.01 = 0.05*.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Pusher never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 100 timesteps.


    ## Arguments
    Pusher provides a range of parameters to modify the observation space, reward function, initial state, and termination condition.
    These parameters can be applied during `gymnasium.make` in the following way:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Pusher-v5', xml_file=...)
    ```

    | Parameter               | Type       | Default      |Description                                               |
    |-------------------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
    | `xml_file`              | **str**    |`"pusher.xml"`| Path to a MuJoCo model                                   |
    | `reward_near_weight`    | **float**  | `0.5`        | Weight for _reward_near_ term (see `Rewards` section)    |
    | `reward_dist_weight`    | **float**  | `1`          | Weight for _reward_dist_ term (see `Rewards` section)    |
    | `reward_control_weight` | **float**  | `0.1`        | Weight for _reward_control_ term (see `Rewards` section) |

    ## Version History
    * v5:
        - Minimum `mujoco` version is now 2.3.3.
        - Added `default_camera_config` argument, a dictionary for setting the `mj_camera` properties, mainly useful for custom environments.
        - Added `frame_skip` argument, used to configure the `dt` (duration of `step()`), default varies by environment check environment documentation pages.
        - Added `xml_file` argument.
        - Fixed bug: `reward_distance` & `reward_near` was based on the state before the physics step, now it is based on the state after the physics step (related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/821)).
        - Added `reward_near_weight`, `reward_dist_weight`, `reward_control_weight` arguments to configure the reward function (defaults are effectively the same as in `v4`).
        - Fixed `info["reward_ctrl"]` not being multiplied by the reward weight.
        - Added `info["reward_near"]` which is equal to the reward term `reward_near`.
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3.
    * v3: This environment does not have a v3 release.
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50.
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks (not including pusher, which has a max_time_steps of 100). Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0).
