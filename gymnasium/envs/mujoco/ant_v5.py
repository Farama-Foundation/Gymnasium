    r"""
    ## Description
    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Schulman,
    Moritz, Levine, Jordan and Abbeel in ["High-Dimensional Continuous Control
    Using Generalized Advantage Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438).
    The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with
    four legs attached to it with each leg having two body parts. The goal is to
    coordinate the four legs to move in the forward (right) direction by applying
    torques on the eight hinges connecting the two body parts of each leg and the torso
    (nine body parts and eight hinges).


    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (8,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    | Num | Action                                                            | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit         |
    | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |
    | 0   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back right hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_4 (right_back_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |

    | 2   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front left hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_1 (front_left_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 3   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front left two links      | -1          | 1           | angle_1 (front_left_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 4   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front right hip | -1          | 1           | hip_2 (front_right_leg)          | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 5   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front right two links     | -1          | 1           | angle_2 (front_right_leg)        | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 6   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back left hip   | -1          | 1           | hip_3 (back_leg)                 | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 7   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back left two links       | -1          | 1           | angle_3 (back_leg)               | hinge | torque (N m) |


    ## Observation Space
    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the ant,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all
    the positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the ant's torso. These may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (107,), float64)` where the first two observations
    represent the x- and y- coordinates of the ant's torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates
    of the torso will be returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, observation Space is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (105,), float64)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                                                  | Min    | Max    | Name (in corresponding XML file)       | Joint | Unit                     |

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table, the observation contains:
    - *cfrc_ext:* 13*6 = 78 elements, which are contact forces
    (external forces - force x, y, z and torque x, y, z) applied to the
    center of mass of each of the body parts.

    The body parts are:

    | id (for `v2`, `v3`, `v4)` | id (for `v5`) | body part |
    | ---|  ---   |  ------------  |
    | 0  |excluded| worldbody (note: all values are constant 0) |
    | 1  |0       | torso |
    | 2  |1       | front_left_leg |
    | 3  |2       | aux_1 (front left leg) |
    | 4  |3       | ankle_1 (front left leg) |
    | 5  |4       | front_right_leg |
    | 6  |5       | aux_2 (front right leg) |
    | 7  |6       | ankle_2 (front right leg) |
    | 8  |7       | back_leg (back left leg) |
    | 9  |8       | aux_3 (back left leg) |
    | 10 |9       | ankle_3 (back left leg) |
    | 11 |10      | right_back_leg |
    | 12 |11      | aux_4 (back right leg) |
    | 13 |12      | ankle_4 (back right leg) |

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).


    **Note:** Ant-v4+ environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.
    If using previous Humanoid versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0 results
    in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py version < 2.0
    when using the Ant environment if you would like to report results with contact forces (if
    contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use version > 2.0).


    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of three parts:
    - *healthy_reward*:
    Every timestep that the ant is healthy (see definition in section "Episode Termination"),
    it gets a reward of fixed value `healthy_reward`.
    - *forward_reward*:
    A reward of moving forward,
    this reward would be positive if the Ant moves forward (in the positive $x$ direction / in the right direction).
    $w_{forward} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$, where
    $dx$ is the displacement of the `main_body` ($x_{after-action} - x_{before-action}$),
    $dt$ is the time between actions which is dependent on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 5),
    and `frametime` which is 0.01 - making the default $dt = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05$,
    $w_{forward}$ is the `forward_reward_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward for penalizing the Ant if it takes actions that are too large.
    $w_{control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{control}$ is `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.5$).
    - *contact_cost*:
    A negative reward for penalizing the Ant if the external contact forces are too large.
    $w_{contact} \times \\|F_{contact}\\|_2^2$, where
    $w_{contact}$ is `contact_cost_weight` (default is $5\times10^{-4}$),
    $F_{contact}$ are the external contact forces clipped by `contact_force_range` (see `cfrc_ext` section on observation).


    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost - contact_cost*.

    But if `use_contact_forces=false` on `v4`
    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost*.

    In either case `info` will also contain the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state
    (0.0, 0.0,  0.75, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range
    of [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] added to the positional values and standard normal noise
    with mean 0 and standard deviation `reset_noise_scale` added to the velocity values for
    stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected
    to be slightly high, thereby indicating a standing up ant. The initial orientation
    is designed to make it face forward as well.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    If `terminate_when_unhealthy is True` (which is the default), the environment terminates when the Ant is unhealthy.
    the Ant is unhealthy if any of the following happens:

    1. Any of the state space values is no longer finite
    2. The z-coordinate of the torso is **not** in the closed interval given by `healthy_z_range` (defaults to [0.2, 1.0])

    #### truncation
    The maximum duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps.


    ## Arguments
    `gymnasium.make` takes additional arguments such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Ant-v5', ctrl_cost_weight=0.5, ...)
    ```

    ## Version History
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3, also removed contact forces from the default observation space (new variable `use_contact_forces=True` can restore them)
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
