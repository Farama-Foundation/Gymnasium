    ## Description
    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Schulman,
    Moritz, Levine, Jordan and Abbeel in ["High-Dimensional Continuous Control
    Using Generalized Advantage Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438).
    The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with
    four legs attached to it with each leg having two body parts. The goal is to
    coordinate the four legs to move in the forward (right) direction by applying
    torques on the eight hinges connecting the two body parts of each leg and the torso
    (nine body parts and eight hinges).

    Gymnasium includes the following versions of the environment:

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (8,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    | Num | Action                                                            | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Type (Unit)  |
    | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |
    | 0   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back right hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_4 (right_back_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 1   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back right two links      | -1          | 1           | angle_4 (right_back_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 2   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front left hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_1 (front_left_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 3   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front left two links      | -1          | 1           | angle_1 (front_left_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 4   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front right hip | -1          | 1           | hip_2 (front_right_leg)          | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 5   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front right two links     | -1          | 1           | angle_2 (front_right_leg)        | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 6   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back left hip   | -1          | 1           | hip_3 (back_leg)                 | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 7   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back left two links       | -1          | 1           | angle_3 (back_leg)               | hinge | torque (N m) |


    ## Observation Space
    The observation Space consists of the following parts (in order):

    - qpos (13 elements by default):* Position values of the robots's body parts.
    - qvel (14 elements):* The velocities of these individual body parts,
    (their derivatives).
    - *cfrc_ext (78 elements):* This is the center of mass based external forces on the body parts.
    It has shape 13 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 78 elements in the state space.
    (external forces - force x, y, z and torque x, y, z)

    By default, the observation does not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    These can be be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In this case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (107,), float64)`, where the first two observations are the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` is set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates are returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    By default, however, the observation space is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (105,), float64)`, where the position and velocity elements are as follows:

    | Num | Observation                                                  | Min    | Max    | Name (in corresponding XML file)       | Joint | Type (Unit)              |

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints in the [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).


    **Note:**
    When using Ant-v3 or earlier versions, problems have been reported when using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0 results
    in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py version < 2.0
    when using the Ant environment if you would like to report results with contact forces (if
    contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use version > 2.0).


    ## Rewards
    The total reward is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost - contact_cost*.

    - *healthy_reward*:
    Every timestep that the Ant is healthy (see definition in section "Episode Termination"),
    it gets a reward of fixed value `healthy_reward`.
    - *forward_reward*:
    A reward for moving forward,
    this reward would be positive if the Ant moves forward (in the positive $x$ direction / in the right direction).
    $w_{forward} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$, where
    $dx$ is the displacement of the `main_body` ($x_{after-action} - x_{before-action}$),
    $dt$ is the time between actions, which is depends on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 5),
    and `frametime`, which is 0.01 - so the default is $dt = 5 \times 0.01 = 0.05$,
    $w_{forward}$ is the `forward_reward_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Ant for taking actions that are too large.
    $w_{control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{control}$ is `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $0.5$).
    - *contact_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Ant if the external contact forces are too large.
    $w_{contact} \times \\|F_{contact}\\|_2^2$, where
    $w_{contact}$ is `contact_cost_weight` (default is $5\times10^{-4}$),
    $F_{contact}$ are the external contact forces clipped by `contact_force_range` (see `cfrc_ext` section on observation).

    `info` contains the individual reward terms.

    But if `use_contact_forces=false` on `v4`
    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost*.


    ## Starting State
    The initial position state is $[0.0, 0.0, 0.75, 1.0, 0.0, ... 0.0] + \mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{15}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{15}]}$.
    The initial velocity state is $\mathcal{N}(0_{14}, reset\_noise\_scale^2 \times I_{14})$.

    where $\mathcal{N}$ is the multivariate normal distribution and $\mathcal{U}$ is the multivariate uniform continuous distribution.

    Note that the z- and x-coordinates are non-zero so that the ant can immediately stand up and face forward (x-axis).


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    If `terminate_when_unhealthy is True` (the default), the environment terminates when the Ant is unhealthy.
    the Ant is unhealthy if any of the following happens:

    1. Any of the state space values is no longer finite
    2. The z-coordinate of the torso is **not** in the closed interval given by `healthy_z_range` (defaults to [0.2, 1.0])

    #### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps


    ## Arguments
    Ant provides a range of parameters to modify the observation space, reward function, initial state, and termination condition.
    These parameters can be applied during `gymnasium.make` in the following way:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Ant-v5', ctrl_cost_weight=0.5, ...)
    ```

    ## Version History
    * v5:
        - Minimum `mujoco` version is now 2.3.3.
        - Added support for fully custom/third party `mujoco` models using the `xml_file` argument (previously only a few changes could be made to the existing models).
        - Added `default_camera_config` argument, a dictionary for setting the `mj_camera` properties, mainly useful for custom environments.
        - Added `env.observation_structure`, a dictionary for specifying the observation space compose (e.g. `qpos`, `qvel`), useful for building tooling and wrappers for the MuJoCo environments.
        - Return a non-empty `info` with `reset()`, previously an empty dictionary was returned, the new keys are the same state information as `step()`.
        - Added `frame_skip` argument, used to configure the `dt` (duration of `step()`), default varies by environment check environment documentation pages.
        - Fixed bug: `healthy_reward` was given on every step (even if the Ant is unhealthy), now it is only given when the Ant is healthy. The `info["reward_survive"]` is updated with this change (related [Github issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/526)).
        - The reward function now always includes `contact_cost`, before it was only included if `use_contact_forces=True` (can be set to `0` with `contact_cost_weight=0`).
        - Excluded the `cfrc_ext` of `worldbody` from the observation space as it was always 0, and thus provided no useful information to the agent, resulting is slightly faster training (related [Github issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/204)).
        - Added the `main_body` argument, which specifies the body used to compute the forward reward (mainly useful for custom MuJoCo models).
        - Added the `forward_reward_weight` argument, which defaults to `1` (effectively the same behavior as in `v4`).
        - Added the `include_cfrc_ext_in_observation` argument, previously in `v4` the inclusion of `cfrc_ext` observations was controlled by `use_contact_forces` which defaulted to `False`, while `include_cfrc_ext_in_observation` defaults to `True`.
        - Removed the `use_contact_forces` argument (note: its functionality has been replaced by `include_cfrc_ext_in_observation` and `contact_cost_weight`) (related [Github issue](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/214)).
        - Fixed `info["reward_ctrl"]` sometimes containing `contact_cost` instead of `ctrl_cost`.
        - Fixed `info["x_position"]` & `info["y_position"]` & `info["distance_from_origin"]` giving `xpos` instead of `qpos` observations (`xpos` observations are behind 1 `mj_step()` more [here](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/issues/889#issuecomment-1568896388)) (related [Github issue #1](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/521) & [Github issue #2](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/539)).
        - Removed `info["forward_reward"]` as it is equivalent to `info["reward_forward"]`.
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3, also removed contact forces from the default observation space (new variable `use_contact_forces=True` can restore them)
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
