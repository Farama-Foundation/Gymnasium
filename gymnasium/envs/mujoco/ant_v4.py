    ## Description

    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Schulman,
    Moritz, Levine, Jordan and Abbeel in ["High-Dimensional Continuous Control
    Using Generalized Advantage Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438).
    The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with
    four legs attached to it with each leg having two links. The goal is to
    coordinate the four legs to move in the forward (right) direction by applying
    torques on the eight hinges connecting the two links of each leg and the torso
    (nine parts and eight hinges).

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (8,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    | Num | Action                                                            | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit         |
    | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |
    | 0   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front left hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_1 (front_left_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |

    | 2   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front right hip | -1          | 1           | hip_2 (front_right_leg)          | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 3   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front right two links     | -1          | 1           | angle_2 (front_right_leg)        | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 4   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back left hip   | -1          | 1           | hip_3 (back_leg)                 | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 5   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back left two links       | -1          | 1           | angle_3 (back_leg)               | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 6   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back right hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_4 (right_back_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 7   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back right two links      | -1          | 1           | angle_4 (right_back_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |

    ## Observation Space

    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the ant,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all
    the positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the ant's torso. These may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will have 113 dimensions where the first two dimensions
    represent the x- and y- coordinates of the ant's torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates
    of the torso will be returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, an observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(111,)`
    where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                                                  | Min    | Max    | Name (in corresponding XML file)       | Joint | Unit                     |

    The remaining 14*6 = 84 elements of the observation are contact forces
    (external forces - force x, y, z and torque x, y, z) applied to the
    center of mass of each of the links. The 14 links are: the ground link,
    the torso link, and 3 links for each leg (1 + 1 + 12) with the 6 external forces.

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).


    **Note:** Ant-v4 environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.
    If using previous Humanoid versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0 results
    in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py version < 2.0
    when using the Ant environment if you would like to report results with contact forces (if
    contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use version > 2.0).

    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of three parts:
    - *healthy_reward*: Every timestep that the ant is healthy (see definition in section "Episode Termination"), it gets a reward of fixed value `healthy_reward`
    - *forward_reward*: A reward of moving forward which is measured as
    *(x-coordinate before action - x-coordinate after action)/dt*. *dt* is the time
    between actions and is dependent on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 5),
    where the frametime is 0.01 - making the default *dt = 5 * 0.01 = 0.05*.
    This reward would be positive if the ant moves forward (in positive x direction).
    - *ctrl_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the ant if it takes actions
    that are too large. It is measured as *`ctrl_cost_weight` * sum(action<sup>2</sup>)*
    where *`ctr_cost_weight`* is a parameter set for the control and has a default value of 0.5.
    - *contact_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the ant if the external contact
    force is too large. It is calculated *`contact_cost_weight` * sum(clip(external contact
    force to `contact_force_range`)<sup>2</sup>)*.

    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost - contact_cost* and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms.

    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state
    (0.0, 0.0,  0.75, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range
    of [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] added to the positional values and standard normal noise
    with mean 0 and standard deviation `reset_noise_scale` added to the velocity values for
    stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected
    to be slightly high, thereby indicating a standing up ant. The initial orientation
    is designed to make it face forward as well.

    ## Episode End
    The ant is said to be unhealthy if any of the following happens:

    1. Any of the state space values is no longer finite
    2. The z-coordinate of the torso is **not** in the closed interval given by `healthy_z_range` (defaults to [0.2, 1.0])

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=True` is passed during construction (which is the default),
    the episode ends when any of the following happens:

    1. Truncation: The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
    2. Termination: The ant is unhealthy

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=False` is passed, the episode is ended only when 1000 timesteps are exceeded.

    ## Arguments

    No additional arguments are currently supported in v2 and lower.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Ant-v2')
    ```

    v3 and v4 take `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Ant-v4', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ...)
    ```

    | `ctrl_cost_weight`      | **float**  | `0.5`        | Weight for *ctrl_cost* term (see section on reward) |

    | `healthy_reward`        | **float**  | `1`          | Constant reward given if the ant is "healthy" after timestep |
    | `terminate_when_unhealthy` | **bool**| `True`       | If true, issue a done signal if the z-coordinate of the torso is no longer in the `healthy_z_range` |
    | `healthy_z_range`       | **tuple**  | `(0.2, 1)`   | The ant is considered healthy if the z-coordinate of the torso is in this range |
    | `contact_force_range`   | **tuple**  | `(-1, 1)`    | Contact forces are clipped to this range in the computation of *contact_cost* |
    | `reset_noise_scale`     | **float**  | `0.1`        | Scale of random perturbations of initial position and velocity (see section on Starting State) |
    | `exclude_current_positions_from_observation`| **bool** | `True`| Whether or not to omit the x- and y-coordinates from observations. Excluding the position can serve as an inductive bias to induce position-agnostic behavior in policies |

    ## Version History
    * v4: all mujoco environments now use the mujoco bindings in mujoco>=2.1.3
    * v3: support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco_py >= 1.50
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
