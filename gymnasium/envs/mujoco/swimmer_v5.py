class SwimmerEnv(MujocoEnv, utils.EzPickle):
    r"""
    ## Description
    This environment corresponds to the Swimmer environment described in Rémi Coulom's PhD thesis
    ["Reinforcement Learning Using Neural Networks, with Applications to Motor Control"](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00003985/document).
    The environment aims to increase the number of independent state and control
    variables as compared to the classic control environments. The swimmers
    consist of three or more segments ('***links***') and one less articulation
    joints ('***rotors***') - one rotor joint connecting exactly two links to
    form a linear chain. The swimmer is suspended in a two dimensional pool and
    always starts in the same position (subject to some deviation drawn from an
    uniform distribution), and the goal is to move as fast as possible towards
    the right by applying torque on the rotors and using the fluids friction.

    ## Notes

    The problem parameters are:
    Problem parameters:
    * *n*: number of body parts
    * *m<sub>i</sub>*: mass of part *i* (*i* ∈ {1...n})
    * *l<sub>i</sub>*: length of part *i* (*i* ∈ {1...n})
    * *k*: viscous-friction coefficient

    While the default environment has *n* = 3, *l<sub>i</sub>* = 0.1,
    and *k* = 0.1. It is possible to pass a custom MuJoCo XML file during construction to increase the
    number of links, or to tweak any of the parameters.

    Gymnasium includes the following versions of the environment:

    For more information see section "Version History".


    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (2,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied between *links*

    | Num | Action                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Type (Unit)  |
    |-----|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------|--------------|
    | 0   | Torque applied on the first rotor  | -1          | 1           | motor1_rot                       | hinge | torque (N m) |
    | 1   | Torque applied on the second rotor | -1          | 1           | motor2_rot                       | hinge | torque (N m) |


    ## Observation Space
    By default, observations consists of:
    * θ<sub>i</sub>: angle of part *i* with respect to the *x* axis
    * θ<sub>i</sub>': its derivative with respect to time (angular velocity)

    By default, the observation does not include the x- and y-coordinates of the front tip.
    These can be be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In this case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (10,), float64)`, where the first two observations are the x- and y-coordinates of the front tip.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` is set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates are returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    By default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (8,), float64)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Type (Unit)              |
    | --- | ------------------------------------ | ---- | --- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
    | 0   | angle of the front tip               | -Inf | Inf | free_body_rot                    | hinge | angle (rad)              |
    | 1   | angle of the first rotor             | -Inf | Inf | motor1_rot                       | hinge | angle (rad)              |
    | 2   | angle of the second rotor            | -Inf | Inf | motor2_rot                       | hinge | angle (rad)              |
    | 3   | velocity of the tip along the x-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider1                          | slide | velocity (m/s)           |
    | 4   | velocity of the tip along the y-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider2                          | slide | velocity (m/s)           |
    | 5   | angular velocity of front tip        | -Inf | Inf | free_body_rot                    | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | 6   | angular velocity of first rotor      | -Inf | Inf | motor1_rot                       | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | 7   | angular velocity of second rotor     | -Inf | Inf | motor2_rot                       | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | excluded | position of the tip along the x-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider1                          | slide | position (m)           |
    | excluded | position of the tip along the y-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider2                          | slide | position (m)           |


    ## Rewards
    The total reward is: ***reward*** *=* *forward_reward - ctrl_cost*.

    - *forward_reward*:
    A reward for moving forward,
    this reward would be positive if the Swimmer moves forward (in the positive $x$ direction / in the right direction).
    $w_{forward} \times \frac{dx}{dt}$, where
    $dx$ is the displacement of the (front) "tip" ($x_{after-action} - x_{before-action}$),
    $dt$ is the time between actions, which depends on the `frame_skip` parameter (default is 4),
    and `frametime` which is 0.01 - so the default is $dt = 4 \times 0.01 = 0.04$,
    $w_{forward}$ is the `forward_reward_weight` (default is $1$).
    - *ctrl_cost*:
    A negative reward to penalize the Swimmer for taking actions that are too large.
    $w_{control} \times \\|action\\|_2^2$,
    where $w_{control}$ is `ctrl_cost_weight` (default is $10^{-4}$).

    `info` contains the individual reward terms.


    ## Starting State
    The initial position state is $\mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{5}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{5}]}$.
    The initial velocity state is $\mathcal{U}_{[-reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{5}, reset\_noise\_scale \times 1_{5}]}$.

    where $\mathcal{U}$ is the multivariate uniform continuous distribution.


    ## Episode End
    #### Termination
    The Swimmer never terminates.

    #### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 1000 timesteps


    ## Arguments
    Swimmer provides a range of parameters to modify the observation space, reward function, initial state, and termination condition.
    These parameters can be applied during `gymnasium.make` in the following way:

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Swimmer-v5', xml_file=...)
    ```

    | Parameter                                  | Type      | Default       |Description                    |
    |--------------------------------------------| --------- |-------------- |-------------------------------|
    |`xml_file`                                  | **str**   |`"swimmer.xml"`| Path to a MuJoCo model        |
    |`forward_reward_weight`                     | **float** | `1`           | Weight for _forward_reward_ term (see section on reward)|
    |`ctrl_cost_weight`                          | **float** | `1e-4`        | Weight for _ctrl_cost_ term (see section on reward) |
    |`reset_noise_scale`                         | **float** | `0.1`         | Scale of random perturbations of initial position and velocity (see section on Starting State) |
    |`exclude_current_positions_from_observation`| **bool**  | `True`        | Whether or not to omit the x- and y-coordinates from observations. Excluding the position can serve as an inductive bias to induce position-agnostic behavior in policies |


    ## Version History
    * v5:
        - Minimum `mujoco` version is now 2.3.3.
        - Added support for fully custom/third party `mujoco` models using the `xml_file` argument (previously only a few changes could be made to the existing models).
        - Added `default_camera_config` argument, a dictionary for setting the `mj_camera` properties, mainly useful for custom environments.
        - Added `env.observation_structure`, a dictionary for specifying the observation space compose (e.g. `qpos`, `qvel`), useful for building tooling and wrappers for the MuJoCo environments.
        - Return a non-empty `info` with `reset()`, previously an empty dictionary was returned, the new keys are the same state information as `step()`.
        - Added `frame_skip` argument, used to configure the `dt` (duration of `step()`), default varies by environment check environment documentation pages.
        - Restored the `xml_file` argument (was removed in `v4`).
        - Added `forward_reward_weight`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, to configure the reward function (defaults are effectively the same as in `v4`).
        - Added `reset_noise_scale` argument to set the range of initial states.
        - Added `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` argument.
        - Replaced `info["reward_fwd"]` and `info["forward_reward"]` with `info["reward_forward"]` to be consistent with the other environments.
    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3.
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen).
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50.
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
