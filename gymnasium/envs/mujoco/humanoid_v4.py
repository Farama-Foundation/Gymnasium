    ## Description

    This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and Todorov
    in ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).
    The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen) with a pair of
    legs and arms. The legs each consist of three body parts, and the arms 2 body parts (representing the knees and
    elbows respectively). The goal of the environment is to walk forward as fast as possible without falling over.

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (17,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.

    ## Observation Space
    Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the Humanoid,
    followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the
    positions ordered before all the velocities.

    By default, observations do not include the x- and y-coordinates of the torso. These may
    be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
    In that case, the observation space will be a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (378,), float64)` where the first two observations
    represent the x- and y-coordinates of the torso.
    Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x- and y-coordinates
    will be returned in `info` with keys `"x_position"` and `"y_position"`, respectively.

    However, by default, the observation is a `Box(-Inf, Inf, (376,), float64)`. The elements correspond to the following:

    Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
    the observation contains (in order):
    - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of mass
    (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10 (*nbody * 10*)
    and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
    - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence
    adds another 84 elements in the state space
    - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has shape
    `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state space.
    - *cfrc_ext:* This is the center of mass based external force on the body.  It has shape
    14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and hence adds to another 84 elements in the state space.
    where *nbody* stands for the number of bodies in the robot and *nv* stands for the
    number of degrees of freedom (*= dim(qvel)*)

    The body parts are:

    | id (for `v2`,`v3`,`v4`) | body part |
    | --- |  ------------  |

    The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are rotational
    DOFs expressed as quaternions. One can read more about free joints on the
    [Mujoco Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/XMLreference.html).

    **Note:** Humanoid-v4 environment no longer has the following contact forces issue.
    If using previous Humanoid versions from v4, there have been reported issues that using a Mujoco-Py version > 2.0
    results in the contact forces always being 0. As such we recommend to use a Mujoco-Py
    version < 2.0 when using the Humanoid environment if you would like to report results
    with contact forces (if contact forces are not used in your experiments, you can use
    version > 2.0).

    ## Rewards
    The reward consists of three parts:
    - *healthy_reward*: Every timestep that the humanoid is alive (see section Episode Termination for definition), it gets a reward of fixed value `healthy_reward`
    - *forward_reward*: A reward of walking forward which is measured as *`forward_reward_weight` *
    (average center of mass before action - average center of mass after action)/dt*.
    *dt* is the time between actions and is dependent on the frame_skip parameter
    (default is 5), where the frametime is 0.003 - making the default *dt = 5 * 0.003 = 0.015*.
    This reward would be positive if the humanoid walks forward (in positive x-direction). The calculation
    for the center of mass is defined in the `.py` file for the Humanoid.
    - *ctrl_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if it has too
    large of a control force. If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the control has
    shape  `nu x 1`. It is measured as *`ctrl_cost_weight` * sum(control<sup>2</sup>)*.
    - *contact_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if the external
    contact force is too large. It is calculated by clipping
    *`contact_cost_weight` * sum(external contact force<sup>2</sup>)* to the interval specified by `contact_cost_range`.

    The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *healthy_reward + forward_reward - ctrl_cost - contact_cost* and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms

    ## Starting State
    All observations start in state
    (0.0, 0.0,  1.4, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a uniform noise in the range
    of [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] added to the positional and velocity values (values in the table)
    for stochasticity. Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally
    selected to be high, thereby indicating a standing up humanoid. The initial
    orientation is designed to make it face forward as well.

    ## Episode End
    The humanoid is said to be unhealthy if the z-position of the torso is no longer contained in the
    closed interval specified by the argument `healthy_z_range`.

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=True` is passed during construction (which is the default),
    the episode ends when any of the following happens:

    1. Truncation: The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
    3. Termination: The humanoid is unhealthy

    If `terminate_when_unhealthy=False` is passed, the episode is ended only when 1000 timesteps are exceeded.

    ## Arguments

    No additional arguments are currently supported in v2 and lower.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Humanoid-v4')
    ```

    v3 and v4 take `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc.

    ```python
    import gymnasium as gym
    env = gym.make('Humanoid-v4', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ....)
    ```

    ## Version History

    * v4: All MuJoCo environments now use the MuJoCo bindings in mujoco >= 2.1.3
    * v3: Support for `gymnasium.make` kwargs such as `xml_file`, `ctrl_cost_weight`, `reset_noise_scale`, etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
    * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco-py >= 1.50
    * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
    * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
