class Env(Generic[ObsType, ActType]):
    r"""The main Gymnasium class for implementing Reinforcement Learning Agents environments.

    The class encapsulates an environment with arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics through the :meth:`step` and :meth:`reset` functions.
    An environment can be partially or fully observed by single agents. For multi-agent environments, see PettingZoo.

    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:

    - :meth:`step` - Updates an environment with actions returning the next agent observation, the reward for taking that actions,
      if the environment has terminated or truncated due to the latest action and information from the environment about the step, i.e. metrics, debug info.
    - :meth:`reset` - Resets the environment to an initial state, required before calling step.
      Returns the first agent observation for an episode and information, i.e. metrics, debug info.
    - :meth:`render` - Renders the environments to help visualise what the agent see, examples modes are "human", "rgb_array", "ansi" for text.
    - :meth:`close` - Closes the environment, important when external software is used, i.e. pygame for rendering, databases

    Environments have additional attributes for users to understand the implementation

    - :attr:`action_space` - The Space object corresponding to valid actions, all valid actions should be contained within the space.
    - :attr:`observation_space` - The Space object corresponding to valid observations, all valid observations should be contained within the space.
    - :attr:`reward_range` - A tuple corresponding to the minimum and maximum possible rewards for an agent over an episode.
      The default reward range is set to :math:`(-\infty,+\infty)`.
    - :attr:`spec` - An environment spec that contains the information used to initialize the environment from :meth:`gymnasium.make`
    - :attr:`metadata` - The metadata of the environment, i.e. render modes, render fps
    - :attr:`np_random` - The random number generator for the environment. This is automatically assigned during
      ``super().reset(seed=seed)`` and when assessing ``self.np_random``.

    .. seealso:: For modifying or extending environments use the :py:class:`gymnasium.Wrapper` class

    Note:
        To get reproducible sampling of actions, a seed can be set with ``env.action_space.seed(123)``.

            The Step API was changed removing ``done`` in favor of ``terminated`` and ``truncated`` to make it clearer
            to users when the environment had terminated or truncated which is critical for reinforcement learning
            bootstrapping algorithms.

        Args:
            action (ActType): an action provided by the agent to update the environment state.

        Returns:
            observation (ObsType): An element of the environment's :attr:`observation_space` as the next observation due to the agent actions.
                An example is a numpy array containing the positions and velocities of the pole in CartPole.
            reward (SupportsFloat): The reward as a result of taking the action.
            terminated (bool): Whether the agent reaches the terminal state (as defined under the MDP of the task)
                which can be positive or negative. An example is reaching the goal state or moving into the lava from
                the Sutton and Barton, Gridworld. If true, the user needs to call :meth:`reset`.
            truncated (bool): Whether the truncation condition outside the scope of the MDP is satisfied.
                Typically, this is a timelimit, but could also be used to indicate an agent physically going out of bounds.
                Can be used to end the episode prematurely before a terminal state is reached.
                If true, the user needs to call :meth:`reset`.
            info (dict): Contains auxiliary diagnostic information (helpful for debugging, learning, and logging).
                This might, for instance, contain: metrics that describe the agent's performance state, variables that are
                hidden from observations, or individual reward terms that are combined to produce the total reward.
                In OpenAI Gym <v26, it contains "TimeLimit.truncated" to distinguish truncation and termination,
                however this is deprecated in favour of returning terminated and truncated variables.
            done (bool): (Deprecated) A boolean value for if the episode has ended, in which case further :meth:`step` calls will
                return undefined results. This was removed in OpenAI Gym v26 in favor of terminated and truncated attributes.
                A done signal may be emitted for different reasons: Maybe the task underlying the environment was solved successfully,
                a certain timelimit was exceeded, or the physics simulation has entered an invalid state.

        This method generates a new starting state often with some randomness to ensure that the agent explores the
        state space and learns a generalised policy about the environment. This randomness can be controlled
        with the ``seed`` parameter otherwise if the environment already has a random number generator and
        :meth:`reset` is called with ``seed=None``, the RNG is not reset.

        Therefore, :meth:`reset` should (in the typical use case) be called with a seed right after initialization and then never again.

        For Custom environments, the first line of :meth:`reset` should be ``super().reset(seed=seed)`` which implements
        the seeding correctly.

            The ``return_info`` parameter was removed and now info is expected to be returned.

        Args:

                If the environment does not already have a PRNG and ``seed=None`` (the default option) is passed,
                a seed will be chosen from some source of entropy (e.g. timestamp or /dev/urandom).
                However, if the environment already has a PRNG and ``seed=None`` is passed, the PRNG will *not* be reset.
                If you pass an integer, the PRNG will be reset even if it already exists.

        ways to implement the render modes. In addition, list versions for most render modes is achieved through

        Note:
            As the :attr:`render_mode` is known during ``__init__``, the objects used to render the environment state
            should be initialised in ``__init__``.

        By convention, if the :attr:`render_mode` is:

        - None (default): no render is computed.
        - "human": The environment is continuously rendered in the current display or terminal, usually for human consumption.
          This rendering should occur during :meth:`step` and :meth:`render` doesn't need to be called. Returns ``None``.
        - "rgb_array": Return a single frame representing the current state of the environment.
          A frame is a ``np.ndarray`` with shape ``(x, y, 3)`` representing RGB values for an x-by-y pixel image.
        - "ansi": Return a strings (``str``) or ``StringIO.StringIO`` containing a terminal-style text representation
          for each time step. The text can include newlines and ANSI escape sequences (e.g. for colors).
        - "rgb_array_list" and "ansi_list": List based version of render modes are possible (except Human) through the
