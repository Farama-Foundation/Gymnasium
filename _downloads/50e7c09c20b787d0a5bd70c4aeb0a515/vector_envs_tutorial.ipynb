        "## Introduction\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to use vectorized environments to train an Advantage Actor-Critic agent.\nWe are going to use A2C, which is the synchronous version of the A3C algorithm [1].\n\nVectorized environments [3] can help to achieve quicker and more robust training by allowing multiple instances\nof the same environment to run in parallel (on multiple CPUs). This can significantly reduce the variance and thus speeds up the training.\n\nWe will implement an Advantage Actor-Critic from scratch to look at how you can feed batched states into your networks to get a vector of actions\n(one action per environment) and calculate the losses for actor and critic on minibatches of transitions.\nEach minibatch contains the transitions of one sampling phase: `n_steps_per_update` steps are executed in `n_envs` environments in parallel\n(multiply the two to get the number of transitions in a minibatch). After each sampling phase,  the losses are calculated and one gradient step is executed.\nTo calculate the advantages, we are going to use the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) method [2], which balances the tradeoff\nbetween variance and bias of the advantage estimates.\n\nThe A2C agent class is initialized with the number of features of the input state, the number of actions the agent can take,\nthe learning rates and the number of environments that run in parallel to collect experiences. The actor and critic networks are defined\nand their respective optimizers are initialized. The forward pass of the networks takes in a batched vector of states and returns a tensor of state values\nand a tensor of action logits. The select_action method returns a tuple of the chosen actions, the log-probs of those actions, and the state values for each action.\nIn addition, it also returns the entropy of the policy distribution, which is subtracted from the loss later (with a weighting factor `ent_coef`) to encourage exploration.\n\nThe get_losses function calculates the losses for the actor and critic networks (using GAE), which are then updated using the update_parameters function.\n\n\n"

        "## Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)\n\nThe Actor-Critic combines elements of value-based and policy-based methods. In A2C, the agent has two separate neural networks:\na critic network that estimates the state-value function, and an actor network that outputs logits for a categorical probability distribution over all actions.\nThe critic network is trained to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted state values and the actual returns received by the agent\n(this is equivalent to minimizing the squared advantages, because the advantage of an action is as the difference between the return and the state-value: A(s,a) = Q(s,a) - V(s).\nThe actor network is trained to maximize the expected return by selecting actions that have high expected values according to the critic network.\n\nThe focus of this tutorial will not be on the details of A2C itself. Instead, the tutorial will focus on how to use vectorized environments\nand domain randomization to accelerate the training process for A2C (and other reinforcement learning algorithms).\n\n\n"

        "## Using Vectorized Environments\n\nWhen you calculate the losses for the two Neural Networks over only one epoch, it might have a high variance. With vectorized environments,\nwe can play with `n_envs` in parallel and thus get up to a linear speedup (meaning that in theory, we collect samples `n_envs` times quicker)\nthat we can use to calculate the loss for the current policy and critic network. When we are using more samples to calculate the loss,\nit will have a lower variance and theirfore leads to quicker learning.\n\nA2C is a synchronous method, meaning that the parameter updates to Networks take place deterministically (after each sampling phase),\nbut we can still make use of asynchronous vector envs to spawn multiple processes for parallel environment execution.\n\nThe simplest way to create vector environments is by calling `gym.vector.make`, which creates multiple instances of the same environment:\n\n\n"

The slower training times might occur\nbecause the gradients of the environments are good enough after a relatively low number of environments\n(especially if the environment is not very complex). In this case, increasing the number of environments\ndoes not increase the learning speed, and actually increases the runtime, possibly due to the additional time\nneeded to calculate the gradients. For LunarLander-v3, the best performing configuration used a AsyncVectorEnv\nwith 10 parallel environments, but environments with a higher complexity may require more\nparallel environments to achieve optimal performance.\n\n\n"
